units		metal    # sets the type of units you want to use. Metal gives you grams/mole for mass for example

boundary	p p p    # sets the style of boundaries. P means periodic, so its periodic in all directions here.

atom_style      atomic   # defines the type of information you give on the atom to the software. Atomic means you give the tag, type, x, v, f, image, mask

pair_style      tersoff  # defines the style of pairwise interaction. Here its the Tersoff Potential.
pair_coeff      * * SiCGe.tersoff  Si(C) # Speciies the pairwise force field coefficients for one or more pairs of atom type

neighbor	0.3 bin # sets the amount of neighbors you include in your neighbor list, and is calculated by energy_cutoff+neighbor. Bin means you make the list per binning.
